# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(to clean the data and use it to answer statistical questions)

## Process
### (your step 1)
 clean & transform the data 

- Remove columns with only NULL cells 
- Change the formatting of time from integer to TIME 
- Change columns with prices to appropriate length
- Remove the spaces before the first character in the product name


### (your step 2)
 Analyse the data based on specific questions

- which countries order the most from the site?
- which countries has the most pageviews?
- which product is the most seller? 
- is there a correlation between the time spent on the website vs purchace? 


## Results
(
-- the country that bought from the website the most is USA and it dominated by 94% sales
-- the United States had 40,000 more pageviews than other countries 
-- google Alpine Style backpack was the most item ordered. 
-- customers that spent 30 minutes or less on the website are more likely to find what they need and purchace. 

## Challenges 
(
-- the challenges that i faced in the project is cleaning the data. i didnt know what to do at the begining which drained a lot of time. most of the data is null and some with values that do not make sense. also, the column names do not indicate clearly to what they are relative to the data. 
 
-- due to the big load of missing values NULL, i needed to use different columns and conduct arithmetic queries to bring forward the problems 
-- another challange was the software pgadmin4 because it kept crashing.
)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

If i had more time i would spend more time crossing the data tables to each other for better QA.
